	<p>
		Our wedding and reception will be held at Zámek Liblice, a baroque castle 40km north of Prague. 
		The venue was designed by Johann Bernhard Fischer and was constructed in the 17th century.
		Today, Zámek Liblice is owned by the Czech Academy of Sciences and is used as a conference centre, hotel and wedding venue.

	<p>
		Zámek Liblice has a hotel, which means you will be able to stay at the wedding and reception venue if you wish. 
		The hotel has a number of family rooms, which we hope will be ideal for guests with young children.
	</p>
	<p>
		We have reserved everyone a room in the hotel for the night of our wedding (the 11th). 
		Rooms in the hotel of the wedding will cost 2400kč, which is approximately £72. 
		We will send you details of your accommodation once you've confirmed that you can come. 
		If you have children, we will also get in contact to check that the room we've booked for you will have room and enough space for you and your family. 
		If you'd rather stay somewhere else on the wedding night, just let us know and we will cancel your room (it won't cost us anything if you tell us in advance). 
		Also, if you'd like to save some cash by sharing with another guest (lots of the rooms have two single beds) let us know who you'd like to share with and we will put you together.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you'd like to stay at the venue the night before the wedding as well (the 10th), please <a href="http://www.zamek-liblice.cz/kontakty.html">contact</a> the venue directly to book a room. 
		We are considering arranging barbecue and wine tasting evening for anyone staying at the venue or in the area the night before. 
		If you would be interested in coming to this, please let us know as soon as possible.
