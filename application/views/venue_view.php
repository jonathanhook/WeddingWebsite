	<p>
		Our wedding and reception will be held at Z치mek Liblice, a baroque castle 40km north of Prague. 
		The venue was designed by Johann Bernhard Fischer and was constructed in the 17th century.
		Today, Z치mek Liblice is owned by the Czech Academy of Sciences and is used as a conference centre, hotel and wedding venue.

	<p>
		Z치mek Liblice has a hotel, which means you will be able to stay at the wedding and reception venue if you wish.
		The hotel has a number of family rooms, which we hope will be ideal for guests with young children. 
		Once we have finalised the arrangements for accomodation with the venue, we will post information about booking rooms in the hotel on this page.
